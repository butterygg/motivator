To implement a new Protocol:

1. Create a new folder in the `protocols` directory with the name of the protocol.
2. Define types of data that will be needed for the protocol.
3. Identify the specifics behaviors on Motivator Core that will be needed to implement the protocol.
4. Update the proxies to handle the new protocol.
5. Create specifics components to handle the new protocol.
6. Update DB Schema to handle the new protocol.
7. Create the Hooks and Server Actions to handle the new protocol.
8. Create the tests to validate the new protocol.
9. Update the documentation.

```
Avoid updating hardly the core of Motivator, try to create new components to handle the new protocol.
```

```
Remember to update the documentation.
```

```
Remember to update the tests.
```

```
Try to use the same patterns and styles that are already used in the project.
```

```
Try making the new protocol as modular as possible.
```

```
If you create components make it reusable.
```

```
If you create new types of data, try to make it as simple as possible.
```
